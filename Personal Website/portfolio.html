<h3>Music</h3>
	<p>Music is without a doubt one of the most important aspects of my life. In the past couple of years at MSU alone,
	I have undertaken a variety of musical projects, both commissioned by others as well as for my own enjoyment. Below is a sampling of 
	some of the more noteworthy or interesting examples.

	<p>The video above is the MSU A capella group State of Fifths performing my vocal arrangement of the Imogen Heap song "Just for Now."
	While I have arranged several pieces for the ensemble, this was the only one to have been performed at one of their concerts. This particular video
	is from December 1, 2011.</p>

    <p>This video is from the Spartan Marching Band halftime show at this year's football game vs. Notre Dame. 
    From 1:07 onwards in the video, you can hear the custom dubstep remix of various Skrillex music I made for the band to choreograph.
    Being able to perform with the band, as well as your own custom music to a crowd of 80,000 is something I surely won't forget anytime soon.</p>

    <p>This is an electronic dance song I wrote in FL Studio 11.</p>

    <p>This is another arrangement for State of Fifths, recorded using the computerized instruments in Sibelius. 
    The song is "New World" by Bjork and I consider it among the best I have arranged.
    I would really like to have it performed live, and hope that State of Fifths includes it in their Spring 2013 program.</p>
