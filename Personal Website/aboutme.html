<h2>About Me</h2>
<div id="maincontent">
<h3>The Past: 0-18</h3>
<p>So, me. I was born June 11, 1991 in Bedford, TX on a blazing hot day. To be entirely honest,
 I don't exactly remember much from that time period (as one shouldn't). All I know is that I lived a pretty
  happy early childhood without any hardship whatsoever. As soon as I got to be the age where
  I could understand language, it became apparent to everyone around me that I had a very strong thirst for knowledge.
  My parents have told me numerous stories about all sorts of intellectual accomplishments I made at a very young age.
  Although I can't remember any of them, I was told that I could read at age 2. I attribute this entirely to rubber bathtub letters.
  My parents would dump the whole alphabet into my bathtub as a baby and teach me the alphabet while I took a bath. By age two they could ask me
  hundreds of words and I could spell them, as well as read new words they made with the letters. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising story I heard about me was told to me by my dad only recently. We were driving along a road when I was three years old
and he noticed in the rear view mirror that my eyes kept bobbing up and down as we went. He realized it was the power lines I was following along with as we drove. I then asked him a question, and the dialogue went as follows:
</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes son&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The electricity from the power plant goes through the wires&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes it does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, why is it that when the electricity reaches the houses they don't catch on fire?&quot;</p>
<p>He was astounded. And so was I after hearing this story from him. At age three, I understood the concept of how electricity worked and how powerful the amperage and voltage was that came from the plant, and how such energy posed a risk. Needless to say, my parents were baffled. My dad explained to me how transformers work and I understood it. The precedent had been set that I MIGHT be a genius, and I've been expected to achieve at a high level since. If anything, I feel like I have gotten nothing but dumber as I've gotten older, even though those around me argue the opposite. </p>
<p>If you had to describe the rest of my childhood, you could call me &quot;that kid&quot;. Whereas most other children my age were out running around, playing outside and getting involved with sports (when it was still safe to run around outside unsupervised in the 90's...), I had a much greater interest in learning about the world and about science. My godfather had the brilliant idea of buying me a microscope kit for my fifth birthday. While other kids might have gotten up on Saturday to watch cartoons, I was awake at dawn looking for new things to put on the blank slides that came with the kit, trying to see what they looked like. I tried my hands at little league sports twice, and failed miserably at both. I was enrolled in a youth soccer club at age 4 and completely disregarded all rules of the game, as I found it pointless. I was also put onto a youth tee ball team to try and spark some interest in physical activity - also to no avail. I was put as a third baseman, and instead of tagging runners out, I would watch the bugs as they flew by and wonder how they got to be the shapes and colors they were - and why they ended up like that. Let's say I wasn't exactly MVP of the team - in fact largely the opposite, if anything. My parents subsequently accepted the fact that I just wasn't cut out for sports, not because I wasn't physically able, but because I was just too disinterested. Nevertheless, they supported my other endeavors. </p>
<p>Once I reached Kindergarten at age 5, there was no stopping my desire to learn. All throughout elementary school, I was reading and learning material for fun, and as a result I had reached reading comprehension levels far beyond my grade. I was reading as well as a high school student by third grade, and by fifth grade I was reading as well as a college freshman. During grade school I found another passion - geography. I found the Earth so fascinating and interesting that I spent all my free time learning as much as I could about the world we live in. The geography bees I participated in when I was eligible in fourth and fifth grade I won without any work, like the answers were just intuitive. Also during those last two years of grade school I got involved in competitive jump roping because of my sister who had done it since first grade. It may sound odd, but if you ever watch videos of people doing it, you'd realize that it is an incredibly physical activity that takes an enormous amount of skill. I'm certain my parents breathed some sigh of relief when I got involved with it, as I was finally exercising daily like a normal kid should be. The national jump roping competition was always held in Orlando, so as a result of mine and my sister's participation, I got to travel to Disney World seven (eight?) times in consecutive years. As a kid, this was a pretty nice deal. But all good streaks come to an end.</p>
<p>Once middle school came around, I started to change. My sixth grade year was an absolute cakewalk; my classes were too easy for me, and by some baffling circumstances I wasn't considered a nerd, I was actually popular. Middle school popularity felt like the best thing ever at the time. It would be short lived though, as once seventh grade came around, puberty hit me like a rogue CATA bus. I was in a much worse mood than I ever had been, and that once burning desire to learn everything I ever could had subsided somewhat. I was still eager to learn, but not as much. I came in second place in the geography bee my eighth grade year, which I was frustrated with at the time (which in retrospect is trivial and funny, because the winner now attends Stanford) The loss in focus and caring was almost certainly due to the new found lack of confidence I had, consequences of the rather unsightly physical changes occurring to me at the time. At the very least, mandatory participation in athletics, including football, cross country and track got me in really good shape, probably better than I am now. The one positive, lasting thing I ever got out of middle school though is my introduction into the world of music. Starting with saxophone in sixth grade (because my best friend from elementary school was doing it) , I realized that music was the thing I had been looking for, as it presented me with both a physical and intellectual challenge. After learning the fundamentals of saxophone, I wanted to learn something else. I couldn't extinguish my overwhelming urge to learn more instruments. I asked for a bass guitar for Christmas one year (much to the chagrin of my sibling), and received it. In a very short time span, I became very proficient, and elected to play it exclusively in the school's jazz band.</p>
<p>Once high school came, the funk I had been in started to turn around. I dropped all sports upon entering high school to focus solely on music. My sister was in marching band and my mother convinced me to do it too, even though I detested how much of a time commitment it would be. Marching in the 100ยบ+ Texas heat for months was not appealing to me in any way. However, the course of one's life can be dramatically altered by seemingly small choices. In this case, I made the right one. I decided (reluctantly) to do band with my sister, and that single decision paved the way for the rest of my life until now. I quickly learned to love it, and devoted nearly all of my extracurricular time towards it. In order to march, I was given a trombone and a spot in the block. I only pretended to play it, but after my first season I taught myself how to actually play it. Ever since, my skill on the instrument improved exponentially to where I was one of the best players by the time I graduated, skipping over my peers who had played it for years before me. Another life-moment occurred early in my junior year when I took music theory. It was then that I realized I possessed a true gift for music. I suddenly realized that I had perfect pitch - meaning that I could hear any tone or chord and immediately recognize what pitch(es) it was and play it back. I could now hear almost anything and visualize it in my head how it looked on paper. I subsequently took up teaching myself piano, which came so naturally at that point that it hardly felt like work learning it. Besides my musical skills, being in band developed my leadership and management skills that I still use to this day. I was Drum Major of the band my senior year, where I was the de facto student leader of 250. I learned so much about people during these years, all of which can be applied to situations in my life currently. Being happy and committed like I was allowed for that curiosity spark to return, and I applied that to my studies. I took all the AP classes I could reasonably schedule, and consequently came to MSU with 42 credit hours entirely from AP tests. By the time graduation came around, I was entirely satisfied with my experience. I knew that I needed to start a new chapter of my life after 18 years in Texas, and the opportunity was on my doorstep. I had known for a long time that my parents were going to move back to their home state of Michigan after I graduated, so I chose to attend MSU in my best interests. They weren't kidding around; we moved literally the day after graduation. Boxes were packed weeks before we left, and loaded up the days leading up to graduation. That day came and went, and in an instant, all of what I had ever lived and known disappeared into the rear view mirror of my truck.</p>
<h3>The  Present: 18-21</h3>
<p>I'm certain that I am not alone in saying that the college years are the most influential in growing as a person. It absolutely has been the case for me, as Iโm sure it has been for countless others. When I arrived in Michigan in June 2009, I had very little in terms of expectations for the next four years and what they would bring me. I had only visited MSU once before starting my freshman year, for a scholarship competition (that I won some money from!) that happened to fall over the most miserable days in February. Needless to say, I wasn't exactly overjoyed at the prospect of having to endure through months of snow and subfreezing temperatures, as I had no experience doing that. However, I came to MSU a few days after I moved to audition for the Spartan Marching Band because I felt as though I needed to continue to experience what I had done for years, albeit in a new and refreshing way. Seeing the campus in its summer glory did wonders on my outlook, as I finally got to appreciate the beauty of the school I was about to call home. Once I started in August, the reality of what I had gotten myself into had shattered my weak expectations entirely. It was beyond anything I had ever imagined, in the best way possible. I rapidly learned to love MSU and everything about it. Being an out-of-stater with absolutely no connections to the school whatsoever was a little scary at first (I'll admit it), but joining the SMB gave me a niche just like in high school within mere hours of arriving on campus. </p>
<p>The desire to learn had returned in full force to me like I was a kid again. During the summer before school started, I thought long and hard about what I wanted to do with my life - the whole reason I was going to MSU in the first place. I realized that although I loved music a lot, I simply could not imagine myself doing it as a profession because I feared that the monumental worked involved would suck the fun out of it in some way; music would become more of a routine and less enjoyable. I dug deeper into myself thinking about what I would like to do, and with some good advice, I made the realization that I loved coding and my studies in digital content creation. I realized that even from an extremely young age, technology was what I cared the most about.</p>
